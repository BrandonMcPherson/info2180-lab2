            <h2>The 2022/23 Season</h2>
            <namedate> September 29, 2022 by Brandon McPherson</namedate>
            <p> <img src="squad.jpg" alt="Barca 2022/23 Lineup" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;">
                I would like to discuss the performance of football club FC Barcelona since the beginning of the 2022/23 season.
                The blaugrana have managed to gain 16 out 18 possible points in the 6 la liga matches defeating all opponents except
                Rayo Vallecano which resulted in a draw and captain Sergio Busquest being sent off.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Catalans' UEFA Champions League campaign has been somewhat of a bittersweet experience with a stunning 5-1 victory
                over FC Viktoria Plzeň but a 2-0 defeat when La Liga top scorer Robert Lawendowski's return to the Allianz Arena.
                The squad looks to continue is impressive form when they travel to the Iberostar Stadium to face 10th place Mallorca 
                in La Liga on Saturday and Inter Milan at San Siro in the Champion's League on Tuesday.

            <p><img src="pedrigavi.jpeg" alt="Pedri and Gavi" style="width:150px;height:180px;margin-left:15px;">
                The team has made a significant turn for the better with the appointment of head coach Xavi, working with president 
                Joan Laporta, has made needed additions to strengthen the squad such as: Robert Lawendowsk, Jules Kounde, Raphina,
                Frank Kessi.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club renewed the contracts of promising youngsets Pedri(19) and Gavi(18) until 2026 ensuring the 
                club's midfield future while also offloading other players to allow more freedom with wages. These players include: 
                Philippe Coutinho, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Dani Alves, Riqui Puig, Samuel Umtiti and Sergiño Dest.
